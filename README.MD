# Google Homepage

This is the first project in the curriculum for The Odin Project foundations course. 
View this project by downloading this repository
and running the index.html file. This simple static webpage consists of three main parts:

 1. Header
 2. Logo and Searchbar
 3. Footer  

Centering elements was awkward at times. Both the header and footer used flexbox display 
models, so their styling was almost identical. Some issues that might be revisited later are
 - Header missing the Profile and Apps icons
 - Searchbar is hella scuffed and needs more styling
 - One of the links in the footer displays in two lines for some reason
